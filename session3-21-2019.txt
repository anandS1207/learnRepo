Yesterday we discussed about 
property binding, attribute binding, class binding



today we will start here

Style Binding 

<button  [style.background-color]="'blue'">ssave</button>


Event Binding

(click)="onSave()"

Event Bubbling 
event bubbling means after successful execution of some event  automatically other exection also will be executed

$event.stopPropagation(); it will stop exection of event bubbling


one way binding  -  changes from ts to html will work but from html to ts will not reflect

Two Way Binding  - <input [(ngModel)] = "email" (keyup)="onKeyup()">

Two Way Binding
