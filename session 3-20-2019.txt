Data and handling events

String Interpolation
<img src ="{{imageURL}}"/>

property binding - methods 
<img [src]="imageURL" />
String interpolation is only for string handlings and displaying strings
property binding is better other than string handling

<tr>
    <td [attr.colspan]="colspas">sdf</td>
